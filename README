Command validation tool

cmdok checks that specified commands are OK. If command is OK than it exists in PATH and can be run. 
It is a simple, small and portable Bash script. It is useful in software packages that want to check that some commands exist before trying to run them.

Example:
~~~bash
$ cmdok gcc
checking gcc ... OK

$ cmdok install tar gzip ar clang
checking install ... OK
checking tar ... OK
checking gzip ... OK
checking ar ... OK
checking clang ... OK
~~~

cmdok retruns '0' on success. It can be used in scripts that check commands before running them. Example:
~~~bash
if cmdok -f install; then
  install ...
else
  exit 1
fi
~~~

cmdok have the followig options:
  -n    disable printing any status
  -f    print status only on fail
  ...   any other options are treated as commands to check
